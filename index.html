							<h3>An awkward undead necromancer with a passion for magic, an enthusiasm for skeletons, a tooth for cookies, a knack for intel brokerage, and above all else, an undying fervor for her darling.<br><br>
							Valkrana will merrily open a corpse to extract its cute skeleton, and can't seem to grasp the concept that this might be taboo. While her stature and awkward, socially-challenged demeanor make it easy to mistake her for a child, she is anything but. Thanks to the influence of her late papa, Valkrana is at home in the cutthroat underworld.<br><br>
							Rather than "me", Valkrana thinks of and refers to herself as "My Darling's me", which illustrates just how deeply she imprinted on her darling. Her clingy obsession is such that she will go to any length, and delight in the privilege of having served.</h3>
							<!--<br><br>
							Many years ago, Valkrana and her darling attempted a ritual meant to tie their fates together; tragically, it succeeded. The ritual shattered her darling's soul, and buffeted Valkrana with the resultant soul-shrapnel, ensuring they'd never be apart. Were it not for their cohabitation of her vessel, her identity would have unravelled at the loss of her darling. Now, she wanders worlds in search of the means to restore her darling.

						<h1 style="font-variant:small-caps">Background</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
						<p>Valkrana stoops to set a steaming cup of tea on the table before you, the porcelain rattling in her hands as she does. A pair of braised-apple and -cabbage cookies rest on the saucer, even though there is a heaping plate of them within reach. The rich, generously-applied scent of her jasmine perfume is enough to mask all but the faintest hint of formaldehyde.
						<p>“Hi.” The stool across from you creaks as she takes a seat. Valkrana removes her bandana, and with her poison-stained poncho, hurriedly but absent-mindedly catches the drool that runs down her chin. She's giving you a weary stare, mouth slightly agape. Strands of potent acid connect teeth made for obliterating bone. The intervening silence passes well into the territory of awkward before she finally blinks and finds something else to look at.
						<p>“Hi.” She addresses you as if she had only just occupied the stool. "Hi. I belong to My Darling." Valkrana places her hands on her cheeks; if she could blush, now would be the time. "Her dreams are my dreams. No one can ever love her as absolutely as I do. But..." She frowns. "I was not always so fortunate." She snatches up a cookie, and grinds it between her teeth as if it were bone.
						<p>If it seemed to you that she was about to get to the point, you were sorely mistaken. The following hour is spent gushing over her darling. Relating her virtues, recounting her feats, and recalling with exactness the details of their relationship. Take day 10,297 of the Era of Rediscovery, for example, whereupon her darling administered a knucklebone, ate cookie dough cookies, visited for the first time with Valkrana a fractured continent, received and giggled at a letter on said continent, enjoyed a scoop of mocha ice cream, cast a spell on Valkrana, successfully and single-handedly explored a frozen ruin in the bowels of the continent, dedicated precious hours to teaching Valkrana a spell, and most importantly, initiated a hug for the very first time. Valkrana rambles on with the honest passion of a stamp collector who had finally been invited to share their collection. Never mind that she hadn't been invited.
						<p>In short, it's a good thing she'd made more tea and cookies. Eventually, she circles back around to her point. "I was not always so fortunate. Before My Darling, well, I guess some of us are born worthless." She takes a sip of tea, wipes the drool from her chin, and begins.
						<p>"I was born into Quellar Vil Galath Faeri Naerel, or the House of the Great Flame Forest. It was, at the time, a well-to-do household led by my father, an accomplished mage and diplomat. My wretched fucking birth would mark the beginning of a swift decline for our family.
						<p>"Papa had always loved dragons. It was not until much later in my life that I learned he did not just love them, he made love to them. This preoccupation eventually brought him to the bed of a certain legendary dragon. That coupling would ruin him, because it would create me. As fate would have it, I was born an elf. And because my soul burned bright with the lineage of my birth mother, this inferior vessel could no more contain it than whey in cheesecloth.
						<p>“During my time with My Darling I came to understand that... that..." She shifts uncomfortably, and pointedly finds something else to look at. "Papa was not a good person. Whatever mob justice he eventually suffered was likely well-earned. But never let it be said that he was not a good Papa to his worthless fucking daughter. He gave me his utmost. Within a year of my birth, he had squandered his savings and bankrupted our household in search of a cure. Our reputation was ruined. We lost everything. Meals were stone soup in slum water. Papa's wife, my adoptive mother, died inexplicably soon after. We could not afford a healer to examine her. However, it would not be far-fetched to say Papa's blatant infidelity and the sudden ruin it invited hastened her demise."
						<p>Valkrana takes a long moment to sip her tea and gnaw at a cookie. Her regular awkwardness has increased markedly since she began her tale. "We are many of us troubled in our adolescence. I do not aim to compete with others. But this is my story, and I will go as far as to say my childhood was not idyllic. Have you ever been hit by a fireball?" She looks at you as if expecting a response, but in her regular awkward way, does not allow you the time to do so, or interrupts any you give. "I have. That is what it felt like to have my own fucking soul in my own fucking body. Always. It was not until later that I knew this was not the normal state of feeling. Destitution, sleep deprivation, and a weakened immune system made me susceptible to illness. Because my bones were too brittle, and because I was always ill, I could not play with the other children. Or at all, really.
						<p>"All I had was my mind to retreat into. And it did not take long to turn my scrutiny on the state of my family. It did not take long to piece together the cause. I had killed Mama. I had fucking, had fucking ruined Papa, had put out all the relatives who depended on him. I was beyond fucking—" Valkrana's temper flares; she begins to shout rather than explain. Sometime while delivering the last few sentences, she began to rake her claws over the table. Valkrana hides her face in her hands. She's drawn taut as a bowstring for the next few minutes, before finally, she seems to have composed herself. Then, she goes on as if it had never happened.
						<p>"I realized I was beyond trash. I gave up. I deserved to die for what I had done to my loving Papa and Mama. And I did. I died." She refills her teacup, and swirls a bony finger in the piping hot brew. "I died. A little too much. I do not know why exactly, but I was not granted a proper afterlife. I discovered that no, some things are not worse than death. It is said that all souls are created equal, but that some are more equal than others. I thought I knew what it meant to suffer." She shakes her head. "I was so utterly mistaken.
						<p>"I fought to live, and I pulled through. According to my Papa, I had only passed over for a minute or so. To me, that experience transcended time. To this day, it shapes me. It stirred in me a deep-seated obsession with the afterlife. Where some feared it, wielded it, or fled it, I wanted to master it. I began dissecting the dead wherever I could find them, which was never all that far in the slums. That was when I discovered the utter, inimitable cuteness of the skellyton. At that time I was determined, but without the direction of necromancy. Not a year later, I decided to seek out the lair of a dragon. In the last stages of my illness I was often delirious, and wished to see for myself why Papa so loved them. Ironically, the condition that had plagued me since birth would not be my downfall. There, in that lair, I would die to the claw of a dragon, and earn my mutilation.
						<p>"By then, an interested party had approached Papa. With nowhere else to turn, Papa was desperate. This interested party, a necromancer, seemed to grasp the underlying issue to my condition, and promised a solution... for a price. He would give Papa's worthless daughter a new lease in life, but not before experimenting on my corpse." She flashes an awkward shark-toothed grin. "And experiment he did.
						<p>"He performed bone grafts, gave me the means to break down and assimilate bone, modified my disposition, and ultimately made an undead scavenger out of me. A graftling. Once he had finished, the necromancer kept his word. An undead is far more resilient than a mortal vessel, so he used his experiment as a chassis, and reunited my soul with my body. Hardly a month after my death, I was returned to Papa."
						<p>Valkrana grows quiet. She has removed one of her gloves, and has one of her skeletal claws suspended before her. It makes small clinking noises as she inspects its digits. "I wonder. I hope My Darling wishes to become a vampire, so that we may spend eternity together." She closes her eye and trails her fingers over her lips, parting them and leaning into her touch as if it weren't her own. "Eheheheh. Eheheheh. My Darling."
						<p>If she realizes she's gone on a tangent, never mind acting strangely, she shows no sign of it. Instead, she presses on. "Papa was still destitute, and I was now a monster. The following years had me  locked in a trunk—starving, raving, and alone but for the voice of Papa. He would sing to me, sing these sweet songs, and on special days, bring me a cookie. These were the only pockets of happiness within my isolation and the unabating hunger of undeath. I craved bones as much as the living crave their next breath.
						<p>"It was not until I had been locked away for nearly two years that I began to seize for myself a measure of control over the hunger. So, it was at this time that Papa began to teach his worthless daughter to ply his trade. By a slit of light, I trained to become a diplomat and mage. Four more years passed before, at last, I was released from the trunk. But..." She turns a pensive frown on her tea, and touches her face as if examining it in her reflection. "Maybe I was always going to be this way. Maybe I was a blank slate. Maybe it is a case of nature against nurture. It does not matter. Whatever the cause, I emerged... me. Unsuited to diplomacy. Unbearably awkward, with an extremely short fuse, and utterly dependent. I often wish I were not aware of these fucking disgusting traits. I do not just see them in myself. I see when others see them." She glances up at you briefly, as if to throw suspicion on anything you might have thought about her during her story, then sighs. "Anyway."
						<p>Valkrana lifts her chin. "For my part, I showed promise elsewhere. I was clever and tenacious. Magic had saved me from certain doom. Magic made me feel as if I were no longer powerless. I was spellbound. By the time I emerged from isolation, I was myself a natural wizard. So Papa found for me  a more proficient mage under whom to apprentice."
						<p>She lifts her chin higher, though what follows doesn't seem to justify it. "That did not last long. Clerics hounded and abused me. My peers reviled and bullied me. I regularly flew off the handle at both parties. I was awkward. I cried for Papa. I drooled buckets. I was fascinated with the dark arts and necromancy. And most of all, I did not respect my master. For all these reasons, my apprenticeship was dissolved.
						<p>"While all this was going on, Papa was busy climbing his way back up the social strata, tooth, nail, and dagger. Around once a week, he would escort me  into the woods, having prepared in his boundless love a corpse for his worthless daughter to devour. I—" At that, Valkrana clams up. She's staring through the table, processing, and once she does continue, it is decidedly less sure of herself. "I... During this time I studied diligently under the same necromancer who had experimented on me. He was more tolerant of my... traits. When I had the time, I would take on the odd... client. Before long, Papa and I had accrued enough... corpses and clients to leave the slums behind.
						<p>"I never grew out of my fascination with death. Only got better at hiding it. I loved Papa, and was supremely grateful for the lengths to which he had gone for me, so when he firmly told me to find another interest, I obliged. Papa had always told me stories of dragons, so for an impressionable young elf who cared deeply for her Papa, I had no qualms with pursuing the field. Even if one had killed me.
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
						<p>“I took his opinion of me to heart. I studied death only in secret. I learned a great deal about myself and the world around me during this time. People are... there is..." She sighs. "Even today I do not understand some of it. I thought having the body of an undead adolescent would get in the way of exploring my sexuality. The opposite, actually. I explored. Thoroughly. I—"
						<p>Valkrana clears her throat, patently embarrassed. "I can enjoy intercourse as one enjoys pleasure. But I have no drive, no physical attraction. None. Maybe I died too young. Maybe it is the undeath. I do not know. What I am leading up to is this: The same people who fucked me  were those who would scorn me in public. My first kill was a cleric in service to a supposedly good deity. He made generous use of me, then left the following morning, only to return with a superfluity of his peers. They brought me to the brink of death before I lashed out."
						<p>She lifts her tea for a sip, but it's shaking enough to spill over the rim. She returns it to its saucer. "People are... surprisingly easy to kill. I never wanted to hurt anyone. Never. No matter how much I hungered for their bones. It had never even crossed my mind. I wanted to be a good person." Valkrana frowns, and her voice assumes the trappings of a quotation. "'Judge me  for what I wish to be, not what the world made of me .'
						<p>"Sometimes I wonder. What if Papa just wanted to be a good Papa to me? To see me  prosper. In that, I would say he succeeded. In my time, despite many setbacks and prejudices, I earned my respect in arcane circles. I worked so, so, so hard. In public, I was a scholar. In private, I learned to manipulate the powers of death. While doing field research for my archmage dissertation on 'The Parental Habits of Dragons and their Ilk: An Ancient Pattern of Negligence', it all fell apart.”
						<p>Valkrana picks at the staple on her cheek, where it holds together a gnarly wound. "I had only meant to observe the nest from above, but the overlook was not as sturdy as I thought. A chunk dislodged and fell to the nest, striking and killing one of the whelps. I was suitably saddened by this, I think. But dragon bones are hard to come by. It made perfect sense to pry a few free of the corpse. Its mother did not think so. Neither did it care that an accident had occurred. She rent my existence with a single swipe of her claw. But she did not kill me. Neither did she take mercy on me. The fucking, the fucking—" Valkrana growls and shoots out of her stool, scraping her claws along the wall as she paces, fuming with fists clenched by her sides. "Fucking cursed me to, to fucking—inhumane is what it was! For the next decade I was forced to follow that spoiled fucking whelp's spirit the world over. It was an accident! A fucking accident! And for that, I had to abandon everything I had worked so hard to achieve."
						<p>She snatches a bone from beneath her poncho and sinks her teeth into it. "The fucking, the fucking icing on the cookie," she snarls between bites. "The fucking icing on the cookie is that I would later discover that this fucking dragon was my birth mother. She gave birth to me, left me for dead, then cursed me. She, she—eheheheh." Valkrana quickly calms down. "It took years, but she got what she deserved."
						<p>Valkrana returns to her seat, somehow managing to look more disheveled than her norm. “I wandered at the whim of a child. Became wanted for breaking and entering. A common criminal. Nations and clerics alike hounded me. Still, I did my utmost to stick to my mantra. To do good despite everything. The worst part was... I..." She tugs her hat down over her eye, but it does not hide her sniffling. "It made me too busy and too ashamed to visit Papa. Now I will never know what he thought of me. Whether he missed me as much as I missed him.
						<p>Then I found the party responsible for his death. I had every right to eradicate them. I fully intended to, up until the last possible second. But… that would not bring Papa back. And I still wanted to be a good person. If I killed him for an accident, how would I be any different than the dragon who cursed me? Besides,” she takes a sip of her tea, “I was already interested in getting closer to Vexia. It seemed to me killing him might have worked against that.”
						<p>Valkrana glares at her tea. "I saw in her a kindred spirit. An outcast the world could not comprehend, not that it had cared to try. We became easy friends, I think. Then I extended my hand to her, and in turn, she kissed me. She gave me my first kiss. More than holding hands, more than a hug, a kiss is the most precious, most meaningful display of love. It is... It is... Eheheheh." She grins wildly and presses her palms against her cheeks. "My Darling kissed me," she says. "Eheheheh." She drags the digits of one hand up her face and over the gaping wound in her skull to sink her claws into it. Valkrana goes on, though it is clear she is still half elsewhere. "Vexia was the first to kiss me. First ever. Then she betrayed me. That smarted dearly. But love is not so fickle. True love is absolute, betrayal or not.
						<p>“Then I lost her. For three decades, I lost her. When, when, when—" She scratches at her neck. "When even a moment without My Darling causes terrible dread to rise in my throat. That is why, that is why, eheheheh, I stopped at nothing to find her. Eheheheh.
						<p>"It is exceedingly difficult to carve for yourself a place among the lawful, especially in secret. But the underworld, the underworld is pliable. With the help of Papa's... wisdom, with an understanding of what drives urchins, and with a figure less likely to raise their hackles, I became their big sister. A kingpin with urchins as my domain.
						<p>"No one wants to acknowledge them, because that will mean feeding them, or admitting that a problem exists at all. This makes them ideal for gathering intel. I expanded the operation to cover adjacent tasks, but intel was always their specialty, and my aim. Because every eavesdropped conversation, every secret shared in confidence brought me one step closer to the whereabouts of My Darling.
						<p>"If I had to watch the world crumble and burn for her, I would have. With tears, yes, but I would have allowed it. Little by little, eheheheh, little by little, I gave myself over to the hunger of undeath. I did not become the person I intended to be; I became the person I needed to be. Eheheheh. Eheheheh. I walked through the night, certain it contained strange and terrible things, and that they were me."
						<p>Valkrana rests her head on the table, looking very far off now. She traces circles over her lips, and emits one of her awkward giggles. "Eheheheh. I found her reincarnation. And she saw me. Saw My Darling’s me. Accepted what I had become. Shared with My Darling's me her broom, her travels, her trust, her life, herself. My Darling showed My Darling's me how to be happy. She made My Darling’s me, My Darling’s me.
						<p>"And now, now I am hers. Absolutely. As the years pass, as the world changes, as people enter and exit her life, I will be her constant. Always and forever. My Darling's me. Whatever she considers worthy, whatever she needs, if I am not that, I will strive to become it. If I cannot, I will help her to find it. Eheheheh. Eheheheh." Her eye is closed, and she quakes under a few sobs.
						<p>"That is what I wished to be for her. Despite her hardships, My Darling gave freely of herself to others. She was the most deserving, compassionate person I have ever known. She shone more magnificent than the most sun-bleached bone. So, I... I gave... all of myself to better My Darling's life. Instead, I snuffed out the most beautiful person to ever exist. The Great and Mighty Ilyana Miraquinal. The, the—"
						<p>She chokes up, then the room goes silent but for the clinking of her bones as they withdraw into her poncho.
						<p>“...” It is a kept silence. Tended. Thick enough with meaning to keep you rooted to your seat for the full twenty-minute stretch.
						<p>When she finally speaks, her voice is sharp with a long-lived hatred. “I am weak. Afraid. A coward. I convinced her to perform a ritual that would bind our fates such that we would never again be apart. It backfired. Now, all that remains of her soul is trapped within this wretched, this fucking repulsive vessel. She is always here—” Valkrana touches her head as if she were caressing a loved one. “—always in my mind. As if she were in the corner of my eye. I can never, can never find her, but she is there. If she were not, I would have lost myself. I am My Darling’s me. Without her, I am no one.”
						Valkrana sighs and sits up. She’s still the same world-weary person you knew a couple hours ago, but there is a strength there you have seen before but only now recognize. An undying fervor.
						<p>“I <i>will</i> save her.”

						<h3>Personality and Physical Description.</h3>
				</label>
				<div class="collapsible-content">
					<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
						<h1 style="font-variant:small-caps">Personality</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
						<p>Valkrana’s predisposition to obsessive and needy behavior manifests as, and is utterly and helplessly focused on, her love for her darling. She managed, if only just, before meeting her darling. But now that they have bonded, it is likely impossible for her to return to a state prior to her having imprinted. Such is most concisely illustrated in the way she thinks of herself as “My Darling’s me”. This has become a crucial part of her identity. Separation from her darling, by even a single wall, causes terrible anxiety.
						<p>One need not look hard for the multifarious symptoms of her illness, even as tangled as they are. Valkrana believes whatever is done for love is done beyond good and evil—a belief that history tells us she is willing to take to any extreme. Based on this observation alone, the elf should be isolated, or kept on a short leash within reach of her darling, whose scruples are more grounded. While unfortunate, the complications surrounding her darling’s death prevent her from resorting to extreme measures.
						<p>Would that this were her only affliction. Valkrana’s formative years were a mess. Embroiled as she was in a surfeit of contributing factors, it is nigh impossible to determine where the influence of one event ends and the other begins. Suffice it to say, her lineage, the early onset of the fear of death, a fascination with dissection, a father who by all accounts was a ruthless villain, her death and reanimation, the acute isolation that followed, and all the subsequent adjustments, or maladjustments: these wrought havoc on her psyche.
						<p>Until the bond forged with her darling, which galvanized a swift and destructive shift in priorities, Valkrana was, above all else, obsessed with mastering death. What she experienced beyond the veil left a lasting impression. Curiously, the elf does not seem to recognize her fascination with liberating dissected bodies of their skeletons as out of the ordinary. On multiple occasions, she has been chased out of town for, as she would put it, innocently scavenging the dead. At first glance, one might believe this is by design—she is, after all, an undead scavenger. However, this oblivious fascination seems to have formed after her first brush with death but prior to her reanimation.
						<p>Valkrana is not without her endearing traits. She is what becomes of a person when the wolf and the sheep are one and the same. While she doesn’t necessarily view the world around her as a child would, she will sometimes interact with it as such. This is especially glaring in her selective filter, in the amusement she finds in inappropriate situations, and in her leaps of logic where interpersonal relationships are concerned. When she timidly flaps her arm at you, failing miserably at something so simple as a wave, it is difficult not to see her and think of a troubled child. When she prattles over her darling with pure, untrammeled love, or when she giggles over how significantly cute a skeleton is as it is jettisoned from a geyser, or when she merrily hums the tune to a song her Papa once sung for her, Valkrana shines.
						<p>Valkrana’s opinion of herself worsens over time, and she scorns herself for any misfortune that befalls her darling. Oftentimes, she’ll refer to herself as worthless or disgusting. This gradual change can be observed in her outlook on baking cookies. She went from enjoying the process for what it was, to viewing cookies as a proxy. In her own words, to her darling, “When the batch has finished, and you and your friends sit around the table and eat the cookies I have made, it almost makes My Darling's me feel as if I am not unwelcome.” Her use of ‘almost’ is telling; that she feels perpetually and irredeemably unwelcome.
						<p>Mostly harmless, maybe even sweet, is her awkwardness. Her socially-challenged nature was made to worsen during her developmental years, when she was either ostracized, locked in a trunk, or both. Valkrana, even when alone with her darling, for whom her trust is absolute, never loses her awkwardness. It is, of course, aggravated in social situations, regularly causing her to evacuate her perpetually unsettled stomach. She is, simply put, an awkward person to her core.
						<p>Between her mother, the dragon; her maladjusted upbringing; and the side effects of the necromancy that maintains her, the origin of Valkrana’s hair trigger temper is a mystery that eludes explanation. More important is respecting it. That when she flies off the handle, you would do well not to encourage her.
						<p>It is worth noting that, despite these observations, Valkrana possesses a keen intellect, and when left to her own devices, has demonstrated her worth in scholarly pursuits. Having grown accustomed to complete isolation, Valkrana has no trouble sitting for days, weeks, even months, absorbed in research. That considered, she doesn’t apply herself like she once did. Valkrana would rather rejoice in a world shared with her darling than sit cooped up all day. However, when the time comes to settle in, when she has finished servicing her darling, cooking, and taking care of chores, Valkrana delights in returning to her studies, surrounded by kept silence, interrupted only by the all-too-welcome breaths of the one with whom it is shared.
						While Valkrana’s hopes of following in her Papa’s footsteps as a diplomat were summarily dashed, she did nevertheless study under her father. Valkrana has none of the charisma, bearing, or tact to pursue the role, but she is quick of wit, which allows her to leverage his Machiavellian wisdom in practical applications where intelligence prevails. In this, she has emulated her Papa to dark ends. It is fortunate then that Valkrana has pledged to put that life behind her, as much as she can. However, Valkrana has in her make-up the predispositions of a villain, inherited from her father and enhanced by her mother. Rarely does she allow them to bubble to the surface, but they are always there, always a part of her.
						<blockquote class="main"><h3 style="text-indent:0em">"I am not a complicated person. I am devoted to you, absolutely. I want to better your life, and I want us to be close. Whatever it takes, I do it. Anything. And I never say, never even think, 'Ilyana must love her me for this.'"</h3></blockquote>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
						<p>That damning appraisal belies her kind-hearted nature. Valkrana gleans no pleasure from hurting others. She will go out of her way to help them, provided that doing so does not interfere with her prime directive. Some would argue that her regular threats run counter to this observation. However, these are little more than a mostly benign product of her trouble with social situations. Rarely are they something she either wants or intends to follow through on. Gods help us all if she ever loses her darling.
						<p><i>Addendum:	We find ourselves in a strange and unexpected outcome. Valkrana both has and has not lost her darling.</i>
						<p>While her dedication in seeking to revive her darling is expected, in this eventuality it manifests alongside a refusal to employ any means necessary to do so. It seems to be respect for her darling that stays her hand. As it is a well-documented characteristic, Valkrana’s tireless pursuit of a solution will not be covered in greater detail.
						<p>Immediately following the death of her darling, Valkrana suffered an observable downturn in mental acuity and temperament. The following were witnessed: severe depression, a degradation of identity, damage to memory integrity and invocation, and an unstable disposition. She chose to counteract these symptoms by using concentrated bone meal to induce a drug-like state, but could not under any circumstances rely on it for an extended time. As has been demonstrated, too much and Valkrana risks succumbing to the hunger of undeath, and had not entirely recovered from the relapse for which her darling administered daily knucklebones.
						<p>While the devastation wrought by her darling’s unfortunate death is likely irreversible, Valkrana is nevertheless fortunate for the way it resolved. It is only thanks to her vessel’s cohabitation that she doesn’t continue to deteriorate—that is, she was saved by what remains of her darling’s soul.
						Ultimately, this leaves Valkrana depressed and slightly unstable, but far better off than she would have been otherwise.
						<blockquote class="main"><h3 style="text-indent:0em">"Choose any path you wish, My Darling. Recognition. Tyranny. The love of another. A quiet life. Then see me. Really look. You will not see an obstacle. Rather, a helping hand. I am short-tempered, awkward, and clingy, but I am, without exception, your friend, and... anything else you allow me to be."</h3></blockquote>
						<h1 style="font-variant:small-caps">Physical Description</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
						<h3>Age: 172, Height: 4'2", Weight: 37+1lbs</h3>
						<p>To the rare few to see her without her wide-brimmed brown wizard hat and skull bandana, Valkrana's most striking features are the three gnarly, bluish-grey wounds raked into her skull. Product of her encounter with a dragon, and cause of death, they never heal. Originally, they were stapled shut, but only a few staples remain.
						<p>Due to these gaping wounds, Valkrana has a difficult time keeping her hair in order. Because of such, she only ever bothers to keep it in one messy braid, allowing the rest to fall as it pleases in oily-black lengths.
						<p>Valkrana lost both eyes in her death, but the necromancer who experimented on her managed to restore her right eye. Once as lovely as amethyst, it is now a pale purple at best. The same necromancer replaced her teeth with a sharklike set better suited to rending carcasses and crushing bone, and widened her mouth to further assist. To the same end, he modified her digestive system to break down bone. She produces these noxious fluids constantly, and as such, can't help but drool. If one were to get into the technicalities of Valkrana's reanimation, she would be qualified as a graftling, which is typically only apparent when her bundle is removed.
						<p>This would lay bare the perverse assortment of bones that were grafted to form her limbs, and the extra skeletal limb or limbs that have been attached to her back. Unlike some graftlings, Valkrana doesn't make a habit of decorating herself with superfluous bones, though she does keep a few that once belonged to her darling quite literally close to heart.
						<p>Valkrana died, and was subsequently reanimated, at the age of ten. Her undeveloped figure, malnourished weight, and manner of dress make it difficult but not impossible to tell her gender. Only her head, neck, torso, and half of one leg contain the marrow- and cartilage-stuff that mimics the meat of her corpse, though she can, over the course of a night, will it to cover all but any extra limbs. With her darling dead, Valkrana makes no effort to do so.
						<p>Her walnut brown Wild West-themed trousers and heavy, layered orange poncho make it clear she either hails from a foreign land, has questionable taste in fashion, or both. Her arcane focus, a polished bone incised with runes, is stowed in a holster on her right hip. On her left, she keeps her spellbook, which looks more like a doodle-riddled many-tabbed cookbook probably because it's also a tabbed cookbook dedicated strictly to cookies.
						Valkrana wears generously-applied lavender perfume that all but masks her regular smell of formaldehyde.

						<blockquote class="main"><h3 style="text-indent:0em">Sifting through Valkrana's tall tales of her Darling requires a fine sieve, but those willing to listen are rewarded with beads of truth.</h3></blockquote>
						<p>Ilyana Miraquinal was raised in the standard trappings of elven society, though she ended up rather... different. She sees herself as the Great and Mighty Witch Ilyana of the famed Miraquinal household, her mission: to prove the magnificence of her family. This belief brought out a haughty, but not malicious, nature in the elf. Her behavior made her enough of a problem child that her family enlisted the help of a wandering "mind doctor" known for fixing problem children. When he failed, Ilyana's grandiose ideas became further entrenched. The great witch had resisted.
						<p>For a time, Ilyana strove to hone her rare psionic talents, which she eventually paired to great effect with wizardry. Until, finally and eagerly, her parents sent her out into the world under the guise of getting actual experience. More likely, they just wanted to be rid of her.
						<p>Some kind-hearted souls in the community scrounged together enough money to buy for her a run-down hovel in the depths of the elven caverns. With her hovel as a base, Ilyana set out on her adventure to spread the glory of Miraquinal. Early on, she went out of her way to help others, expecting only gratitude in return. Money means little to her; she'd rather hear words of praise. However, the harshness of the world eventually got through to her. While a smile meant more to her than any coin, she realized that in order to survive, and eventually flourish, she would need money. This she lived for many years, getting by and adventuring by her lonesome. Until...
						<p>An urchin handed her a letter gritty with sand and dust. The letter contained an invitation to the notorious Outfit, along with a promise of the recognition she sought. She figured the Outfit knew a thing or two about self-promotion. If anyone could help her achieve her dream, they ranked high. So she set out.
						<p>Perhaps the Outfit wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Its core crew was powerful but disfunctional. To make matters worse, one member in particular clung to her like nobody's business, claiming Ilyana was the reincarnation she'd been searching for all along. This was, of course, Valkrana. Nevertheless, Ilyana saw an opportunity and seized it: she fashioned herself the leader of this Outfit. Between her noble carriage, the image she painted of herself, and the support of a core member, she was the prime candidate for this ragtag group of sometimes-do-wells.
						<p>Now at the helm, she led her party on a great many adventures, and indeed, succeeded in spreading the Miraquinal name far and wide. The Outfit gave way to the Miraquinals. They thrived. This band of comrades achieved a great deal together, and during their exploits, love would soon bloom.
						<p>Perhaps Ilyana only meant to entertain Valkrana at first, or placate her otherwise. But time passed, and eventually she accepted Valkrana's unabating affection. Ilyana wasn't one for public displays, but she cared, and showed it in her own way. They looked after one another. Each knew what the other needed. Each provided.
						<p>That is, until Valkrana convinced Ilyana to defy fate itself. To perform a ritual that would tie their fates together. Technically, they succeeded. But fate is cruel to those who challenge it and fail. The ritual backfired, shattering Ilyana's soul, and buffeting Valkrana with the resultant soul-shrapnel. Neither emerged unscathed. Now, all that remains of Ilyana is a silent passenger lodged in the soul of her lover.

						<h1>GRAFTLING TRAITS</h1>
						<h3>ASI: Con+2, Wis+1; Speed: Varies; Size: Varies</h3>
						<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Age.</b> Graftlings do not age. They are sustained by the magic that created them.<br><br>
						<b>Alignment.</b> Graftlings are reclusive, and tend toward a neutral alignment. However, this may have been influenced by their transformation and surviving identity.<br><br>
						<b>Grave Inheritance.</b> Determine the race you were in life. You have that race's size, base walking speed, and languages. To some extent, you still resemble that race.<br><br>
						<b>Darkvision.</b> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.<br><br>
						<b>Skeletal.</b> Your creature type is undead. You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and resistance to poison damage. You don't require air, food, drink, or sleep. A long rest amounts to four hours in an inactive but conscious state.<br><br>
						<b>Graftling Physiology.</b> Your skeleton is receptive to further perversion. You can spend 10 minutes to permanently graft purely decorative bones anywhere on your body. Additionally, if it has bones, you can graft the arm of a creature no larger than you and it becomes functional. You may only have one limb attached in this manner, and may remove it at will. When attached:
						<p style="margin-left:15px; text-indent:0em">&bull; You can interact with a second object as part of your free action.<br>
						&bull; If two of your arms are wielding weaponry, you can't benefit from a shield.
						<p style="text-indent:0em"><b>Marrowsense.</b>	You have a nose for bone. As a bonus action, until the end of your next turn, you can use this ability to detect the location and creature type of unexposed bone within 30 feet and exposed bone within 60 feet.<br>
						
						<p style="text-indent: 0.5em"><i>This ability can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, 3 feet of wood, or 7 feet of dirt. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</i>
