				<!-- VALKRANA OVERVIEW -->
				<div class="grid">
					<div>
						<h1 style="font-variant:small-caps">Overview</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
						<p class="overview"><span style="color:#fc49b2">Awkward.</span> Valkrana's awkwardness knows no bounds. Her impaired social skills and selective filter often leave the wrong impression. Even when left to her own devices, her mannerisms all exude awkwardness.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Low-energy.</span> Aloof, operates at low battery. Certain things, such as magic or her darling, will kick Valkrana into a higher gear, but she's quick to return to her default.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Arcana.</span> The arcane gave her a second chance at life, it gave her power. Valkrana's respect for and admiration of all things arcane leads her to seek out new magicks solely for the pleasure of finding them. And using them.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Skeletons.</span> Finds skeletons eminently cute <i>'because of the way they are'</i>. Since childhood, she's opened corpses to grin at their skeletons, oblivious to taboo. She'll dress, disassemble, dance with, and of course, dissect them.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Necromancy.</span> Removes the meat before reanimation, and a number of her tailored spells, such as Skelegram and Skeleport, integrate skeletons. More than fodder, she makes extensive use of their utility: from manning vessels to heavy loads.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Urchin.</span> Born of a world dragon and elf, her draconic soul was too intense for her elven body. Her papa squandered everything in botched attempts at a cure. Valkrana's childhood was all so much squalor, and the suffering of a host consumed by its soul.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Death.</span> Her papa loved dragons, wove for her wondrous stories of them, and had maps of their whereabouts. 10-year-old Valkrana slipped away to the lair of a black dragon. There, she was slain. This has since fueled her desire to master and overcome death.<br>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="overview"><span style="color:#fc49b2">Graftling.</span> Desperate, her papa delivered her mangled remains to an old acquaintance, a necromancer. Valkrana was reborn as a graftling, an experimental, bone-grafted skeletal undead, her reanimated body now able to withstand her draconic soul.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Cookies.</span> During the isolation that followed, Valkrana's papa would reward good behavior with a cookie. She came to see them as a token of affection. Now, she bakes them for others as a way to try to find her place with them. She puts some weird stuff in cookies though.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Ilyana.</span> Her darling. Rather than 'me', Valkrana thinks of and refers to herself as 'my darling's me', which illustrates just how deeply she imprinted on Ilyana. In her clingy, yandere-like obsession, she'll go to any length for Ilyana, delighting in the privilege. They complement one another perfectly.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Intel.</span> 'Information,' she says, 'is the most valuable commodity.' Valkrana values not only knowledge gleaned from books, but from the ears of urchins, the lips of tipsy officials, the archives of governments.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Underworld.</span> Thanks to the villainous influence of her late papa, Valkrana can navigate the cutthroat world of thieves and assassins. She once carved a place for herself there as a powerful infomonger. While that time has passed, her expertise has not.<br>
						<span style="color:#fc49b2">Otherworldly.</span> Valkrana has travelled to new planes, worlds, and universes in seeking a way to restore her darling's soul. This journey makes her appearances in multiple campaigns, settings, and systems canon to the character.

						Valkrana fumbles multiple greetings, and your board. All that effort keeping it dry; now it's damp and dirty. She doesn't seem to care, just focuses on the lines to your sides. Whispers erupt around you. You can't help but shiverâ€”yours might just be the first shikishi with a personal touch! You place it before her. She regards your soiled board with contempt only as long as it takes to place her autograph. You shiver at that, too. Then her attention flicks to the boards at her other two hands as she slides yours forward without another word. You snatch it up and hurry off, too overcome with glee to notice all the envious stares trained your way. What a rush! What a wonder! She didn't even care! This was worth your life savings!</i></div>
