								<p><i>An awkward undead necromancer with a passion for magic, an enthusiasm for skeletons, a tooth for cookies, a knack for intel brokerage, and above all else, an undying fervor for her darling.</i><br><br>
								Valkrana is an original character who spans mediums, systems, and tabletop campaigns. She has appeared as a prominent NPC in two campaigns for a homebrew system, and several D&D one-shots. She was a player-character in the Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Ghosts of Saltmarsh D&D modules. Her tabletop adventures continue in the Greyhawk universe.<br><br>
								Valkrana is the inspiration for several TTRPG homebrews, most popularly, the graftling race and <a href="https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/gameaddon/11632/deck-of-many-bones" target="_blank">Deck of Many Bones</a>. Many talented artists have illustrated her, and most of their works can be found in the gallery. An <a href="guide.html" target="_blank">art guide</a> is available for anyone interested in contributing. Side art by <a href="https://twitter.com/toixxy" target="_blank">Toi</a>.
								<!--Valkrana will merrily open a corpse to extract its cute skeleton, and can't seem to grasp the concept that this might be taboo. While her stature and awkward, socially-challenged demeanor make it easy to mistake her for a child, she is anything but. Thanks to the influence of her late papa, Valkrana is at home in the cutthroat underworld.<br><br>
								Rather than "me", Valkrana thinks of and refers to herself as "My Darling's me", which illustrates just how deeply she imprinted on her darling. Her clingy obsession is such that she will go to any length, and delight in the privilege of having served.</h3>
								<br><br>
								Many years ago, Valkrana and her darling attempted a ritual meant to tie their fates together; tragically, it succeeded. The ritual shattered her darling's soul, and buffeted Valkrana with the resultant soul-shrapnel, ensuring they'd never be apart. Were it not for their cohabitation of her vessel, her identity would have unravelled at the loss of her darling. Now, she wanders worlds in search of the means to restore her darling.

				<!-- VALKRANA OVERVIEW -->
				<div class="grid">
					<div>
						<h1 style="font-variant:small-caps">Overview</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
						<p class="noindent"><b>Awkward.</b> Valkrana's awkwardness knows no bounds. Her impaired social skills and selective filter often leave the wrong impression. Even when left to her own devices, her mannerisms all exude awkwardness. When she fails miserably at a wave, she's trying her best, and knows all too well she's failed.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Arcana.</b> Magic excites her. The arcane didn't just give her a second chance at life, it gave her power. Valkrana's respect for and admiration of all things arcane leads her to seek out new magicks solely for the pleasure of finding them. And using them.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Skeletons.</b> Valkrana finds skeletons eminently cute <i>'because of the way they are'</i>. As a child, she would open corpses to grin at their skeletons, oblivious to tabooâ€”a practice she continues to this day. She'll dress, disassemble, dance with, and of course, dissect them.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Necromancy.</b> It's no wonder then that her necromancy focuses chiefly on skeletal subjects. Valkrana removes the meat before reanimation, and a number of her tailored spells, such as Skelegram and Skeleport, integrate skeletons. More than fodder, she makes extensive use of their utility: from manning vessels to heavy loads.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Urchin.</b> Valkrana was doomed to an early death. Born of an elder dragon and wood elf, her draconic soul was too intense for her elven body. Her papa, head of the well-to-do House Faeri Naerel, squandered everything in botched attempts at a cure. Her childhood was all so much squalor, and the suffering of a host consumed by its soul.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Death.</b> Her papa loved dragons, wove for her wondrous bedtime stories of them, and had maps of their whereabouts. 10-year-old Valkrana slipped away to follow one such map to the lair of a black dragon. There, she was slain. This has since fueled her desire to master and overcome death.
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Graftling.</b> Desperate, her papa delivered her mangled remains to an old acquaintance, a necromancer. Valkrana was reborn as a graftling, an experimental, bone-grafted skeletal undead, her reanimated body now able to withstand her draconic soul.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Cookies.</b> During the years of isolation that followed her reanimation, Valkrana's papa would reward good behavior with a bonemeal cookie. She came to see them as a token of affection. Now, she bakes them for others, and uses cooking as a way to try to find her place with others. She puts some weird stuff in cookies though.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Ilyana.</b> Her darling. Rather than "me", Valkrana thinks of and refers to herself as "My Darling's me", which illustrates just how deeply she imprinted on Ilyana. Her clingy, yandere-like obsession is such that she will go to any length for Ilyana, and delight in the privilege of having served. Valkrana's prime directive is, "What is done for My Darling is done beyond good and evil." They complement one another perfectly.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Intel.</b> 'Information,' she says, 'is the most valuable commodity.' Valkrana values not only knowledge gleaned from books, but from the ears of urchins, the lips of tipsy officials, the archives of governments.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Underworld.</b> Thanks to the villainous influence of her late papa, Valkrana can navigate the cutthroat world of thieves and assassins. She once carved a place for herself there, with urchins as her domain and intel as her specialty. While that time has passed, her expertise has not.
						<p class="noindent"><b>Otherworldly.</b> Valkrana has travelled to new planes, worlds, and universes in seeking a way to restore her darling's soul. This journey makes her appearances in multiple campaigns, settings, and systems all canon to the character.
