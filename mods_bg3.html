				<p class="noindent">Move over, Rary. Blow it up your ass, Bigby. Valkrana's signature spells are here. Voted Nexus Mod of the Month, Valkrana's Spellbook adds 13 new necromancy spells crafted by the multiverse's most awkward necromancer, available to all spellcasters. Valkrana's Lesser Skeleport in particular is a favorite, and an adaptation of a custom spell from the character's early days. Others add new skeletal summons, earlier reanimation options, inflatable pools brimful with negative energy, and more.</p>

						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: 40 feet<br>
						Duration: Instantaneous<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> Animate a corpse or collection of bones to create 2 miniature glow-in-the-dark skeletons. These skeletons are brittle and deal chip damage, but maintain their utility, soak attacks, can combo with other spells or effects, and emit a mellow green light in darkness that illuminates a 5-foot radius.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional corpse or collection of bones for each slot level above 1st.

						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: 60 feet<br>
						Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> You ply a gray network, using spirits from the Fugue to extract a secret from even the most guarded soul. Each creature in a 5-foot radius of a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have its soul exposed, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. On a failed save, an affected creature also can't benefit from invisibility or Sanctuary for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or lower, or that don't otherwise have a soul, are unaffected by this spell.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Bone Liquefaction</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">2nd-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Bonus Action<br>
						Range: 40 feet<br>
						Duration: 1 minute<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> You weaponize the necromancy fundamental to a graftling's caustic stomach acid. Target creature within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become inflicted with Bone Liquefaction for one minute. Until the spell ends, the target suffers 2 acid damage at the start of its turn, whenever it makes an attack, or upon taking Necrotic damage. This damage increases by 1 per turn for the duration of this spell. Target must have a skeleton.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1 and you may target an additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Impart Undeath</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">3rd-level necromancy (ritual)<br>
						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: Touch<br>
						Duration: Permanent<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> Infuse an allied creature with undeath. The nature of undeath means many spells and effects interact with you differently, or not at all. You are immune to disease and poison, and have advantage on death saving throws. While below 25% of your maximum HP, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier at the start of your turn (minimum 1), provided you are not downed in combat. May be removed with Remove Curse.<br><br>
					</div>
					<div class="item-spells">

						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: Self<br>
						Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> Channel a 30-foot field thick with necromancy that harms the living and empowers the undead. When an undead enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it heals 1d8HP, adds 1d8 Necrotic damage to its attacks, and gains Turn Resistance; a living enemy will instead suffer 1d8 Necrotic damage. Many reanimation spells don't require a corpse due to the abundance of negative energy in its area. Requires Concentration. 1-minute duration.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 9th level, it lasts until a long rest.

						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Unsealed Soul</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">4th-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: 20 feet<br>
						Duration: Instantaneous<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> Release the seals on your soul. Target creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving shrow or take heavy force damage. Each seal released reduces your maximum HP by 33% and increases your spell save DC by 1. Cannot release seals if doing so would put you over three total seals released. Soul seals are restored after a long rest.<br><br>
						&#8226; Release Minor Seal: Release one soul seal. Target creature takes Force damage equal to your current HP. Your HP is reduced to 1.<br>
						&#8226; Release Major Seal: Release two soul seals. Target creature takes Force damage equal to twice your current HP. You die.

					<div class="item-spells">
						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Rigged Graveyard</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">5th-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: 60 feet<br>
						Duration: Until dispelled or triggered<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> You fetter and condense negative energy to rig all corpses within a 40-foot-radius sphere of a point within range. Whenever an enemy comes within 15 feet of a rigged corpse, the corpse explodes, and each creature within 15 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d12 necrotic damage and is thrown 15 feet away from the blast. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't thrown back. The Corpse Preservation Bill prevents this spell from targeting the same corpse twice.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 5th.
					</div>
					<div class="item-spells">

If a humanoid creature dies to this spell, its meat sloughs cleanly from its skeleton, and it is reanimated as a blood skeleton permanently under your control.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 6th, alternating between necrotic and piercing.

				<br><h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Spell List Compatibility</h1>
				<p class="flush">With Script Extender: Includes dynamic automatic support for modded warlock subclasses. Spell list support also added for most vanilla lists, Artificer, Chronurgy Wizard, Graviturgy Wizard, Magus, Troubadour, Vanguard.
				<p class="flush">Without Script Extender: Spell list support added for most vanilla lists, Artificer, Chronurgy Wizard, Dread Overlord Warlock, Graviturgy Wizard, Hexblade Warlock, Magus, Troubadour, Vanguard, Undead Warlock. Other class and subclass mods will need to manually add compatibility.</p>

				<br><br><h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Installation</h1>
				<p class="noindent">1. Install with BG3MM, MO2, Vortex, or manually<br>
				2. Follow general load order as outlined on the downloads page, or in mod descriptions<br>
				3. Crack open a brewski and pry open a casket</p>

				<br><h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Notes</h1>
				<p class="flush">Found on scrolls and in level-up selection. Supports spell slots up to 9th level.
				<p class="flush">Users with Script Extender installed will find that enemy spellcasters now have access to Valkrana's spells. This only applies to spellcasters that A. Have one of the following tags: undead, skeleton, Myrkul, wizard_necromancy; B. Have the appropriate spell slots for a given spell; and C. Roll a 20% chance to learn a given spell. Once these requirements have been met, a creature can learn a single spell from the Spellbook. 
				<p class="flush">In SE console, you can press enter ("S >>" should appear) then input the !learn_valkranaspells command. This will add Valkrana's spells to the currently selected character as always-prepared spells that still require spell slots. You can use !unlearn_valkranaspells to remove them.
				<p class="flush">With Absolute Wrath active, "absolutist" creatures tagged as undead or wizard learn Valkrana's Lesser Skeleport.
				<p class="flush">Thanks to alaskandan7 for valuable bug reports, isamuchu's insight wrt skeleton weapon skills, Antemaxx for a solid icon reference, and those like LaughingLeader and Norbyte whose contributions to BG3 modding have been invaluable. Celes for being a real stand-up feller, and offering tips and other vital info.</p>
