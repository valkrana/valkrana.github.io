				<p class="noindent">Move over, Rary. Blow it up your ass, Bigby. Valkrana's signature spells are here. <span style="color:#95d690">Voted Nexus Mod of the Month with well over 100k unique downloads, Valkrana's Spellbook adds 15 new necromancy spells crafted by the multiverse's most awkward necromancer.</span> Valkrana's Lesser Skeleport in particular is a favorite, and an adaptation of a custom spell from the character's early days. Others add new skeletal summons, earlier reanimation options, inflatable pools brimful with negative energy, and more. Available to all spellcasters, these highly-polished spells are replete with custom VFX, creatures, and animations.</p>

						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: Touch<br>
						Duration: Permanent<br>
						<p class="noindent"><b>Description:</b> Infuse an allied creature with undeath. The nature of undeath means many spells and effects interact with you differently, or not at all. You are immune to disease and poison, and have advantage on death saving throws. While below 25% of your maximum HP, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier at the start of your turn (minimum 1), provided you are not downed in combat.

Soul seals are restored after a long rest.<br><br>
						&#8226; Release Minor Seal: Release one soul seal. Target creature takes Force damage equal to half your current HP. Your HP is reduced to 1.<br>

				<p class="flush">Found on scrolls and in level-up selection. Supports spell slots up to 9th level.
				<p class="flush">Users with Script Extender installed will find that enemy spellcasters now have access to Valkrana's spells. This only applies to spellcasters that A. Have one of the following tags: undead, skeleton, Myrkul, wizard_necromancy; B. Have the appropriate spell slots for a given spell; and C. Roll a 20% chance to learn a given spell. Once these requirements have been met, a creature can learn a single spell from the Spellbook. 
				<p class="flush">In SE console, you can press enter ("S >>" should appear) then input the !learn_valkranaspells command. This will add Valkrana's spells to the currently selected character as always-prepared spells that still require spell slots. You can use !unlearn_valkranaspells to remove them.
				<p class="flush">As above in SE console, input !add_valkranascrolls to add a scroll to your inventory for each spell.
				<p class="flush">With Absolute Wrath active, "absolutist" creatures tagged as undead or wizard learn Valkrana's Lesser Skeleport.
				<p class="flush">Thanks to alaskandan7 for valuable bug reports, isamuchu's insight wrt skeleton weapon skills, Antemaxx for a solid icon reference, and those like LaughingLeader and Norbyte whose contributions to BG3 modding have been invaluable.

				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Free Skeletons!</h1>
				<p class="noindent">The clerics don't want you to know this, but the skeletons in the graveyard are free. You can take them home. Just select the character who wants a skeleton, open Script Extender console, press enter, then type !vsc_freeskeleton and press enter again.</p>

				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Installation</h1>
				<p class="noindent">0. Requires Norbyte's Script Extender<br>

				3. Crack open a brewski and pry open a casket</p>

				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Notes</h1>
				<p class="flush">Includes a toggleable passive to temporarily disable skeleton spawns.
				<p class="flush">If, by chance, a friendly skeleton doesn't disappear after combat, it should do so after a short or long rest. At any time, you can open Script Extender console and input the !vsc_sweeper command to clear all active skeletons, excluding those from the Limited Edition Bone.
				<p class="flush">Skeletons don't award XP by default. If you want them to yield XP, download the optional XP Enabled mod.
				<p class="flush">Yara the Planar Bladesinger only spawns with the Skeletal Challenge or Undead Encounters mods active.
				<p class="flush">10-second internal cooldown.
				<p class="flush">Due to an ancient feud between Valkrana and Lump, the skeletons and Lump will attack one another if you summon Lump in combat.
				<p class="flush">Includes support for and will spawn skeletons from the following mods: Valkrana's Spellbook, Animate Dead++, Tombstone Undead, Dread Overlord, Casamir and Sedrick.
				<p class="flush">Aheram the Warlock, Deathmage of the Order of the Dracolich, is added to the pool when the Dread Overlord mod is active.

				<h1 class="altclr">Valkrana's Undead Encounters</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
				<p class="noindent">When Valkrana dropped by your corner of Realmspace,	she left some skeletons behind... as a treat. Adds undead encounters scattered across all acts. Voted Nexus Mod of the Month.
				<br><br>					
				The goal of this mod is to supplement existing encounters&mdash;vanilla or modded&mdash;while avoiding inundating the player with undeath or flooding the map with encounters. Includes <span style="color:#95d690">allied, neutral, and hostile mobs with custom appearances and stats</span>, and <span style="color:#b3a1a5">fully-developed bosses&mdash;replete with both Legendary Actions and Lair Actions&mdash;that drop new weapons and other magical items</span>. Full encounter list further down.</p>

				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Installation</h1>
				<p class="noindent">0. Requires Valkrana's Skeleton Crew and Norbyte's Script Extender<br>
				1. Install with BG3MM, MO2, Vortex, or manually<br>
				2. Follow general load order as outlined on the downloads page, or in mod descriptions<br>
				3. Crack open a brewski and pry open a casket</p>

				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Notes</h1>
				<p class="flush">Almost all mobs have custom appearances that you haven't seen anywhere else in the game.
				<p class="flush">Bosses are full-featured, and Mao even has Lair Actions&mdash;a 5e feature not yet seen in BG3.
				<p class="flush">Friendly and neutral encounters could end up joining your party if you play your cards right.
				<p class="flush">Non-boss mobs don't award XP. If you want them to yield XP, download the optional XP Enabled mod when you grab Valkrana's Skeleton Crew.
				<p class="flush">Should be safe to add to existing saves.
				<p class="flush">A couple combat encounters only appear in the place of certain defeated humanoid encounters.
				<p class="flush">Bosses will talk to you a few times during fights.</p>
				<br>
				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Console Commands</h1>
				<p class="noindent"><i>Use these debug commands in Script Extender console sparingly and at your discretion as they can have unforeseen consequences.</i><br>
				!vue_reset will cause all VUE spawns to be repopulated upon leaving and loading into a level. Won't always clear active spawns.<br>
				!vue_clearfollowers will remove all living undead followers.<br>
				!vue_cleardeadfollowers will remove all dead undead followers.<br>
				!vue_removecomrades and !vue_addcomrades will remove/re-add the "Bones Alive!" skeletons from/to your party.</p>

				<h1 class="altclr">Valkrana's Skeleton Emporium</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
				<p class="noindent"><span style="color:#95d690">Adds over 50 undead options to the Animate Dead spell!</span>—most of which are custom, all of which are skeletons.
				<br><br>
				<i>Rattle on over to Valkrana's Skeleton Emporium for only the rarest skeletons! Come see our mercury-gilded skeletons, skeletons from a geyser, jumping skeletons, skeletons with machine guns, moss-covered skeletons, and even four-armed skeletons! Wow! Visit Today!</i>
				<br><br>
				This mod does what it says on the box. If bone meal is, as they say, the spice of life, then your life is about to be heaped with way too much cinnamon and turmeric. The Emporium adds skeletons from and requires Valkrana's Skeleton Crew. If you don't want the functionality of that mod, use the Feat version and don't take the feat.</p>

				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">Notes</h1>
				<p class="flush">General color-coding legend: orange is melee, blue is ranged, purple is caster.
				<p class="flush">Supports upcasting for spell slots up to 9th level.
				<p class="flush">The new spells don't have summon stack limits.
				<p class="flush">Over half of the skeletons are custom, which are at or near basic skeleton power level; some were given minimal class progressions (labeled archetypes) as 4th-level upcasts; the remainder were pulled directly from preexisting creatures.</p>
				<br>
				<h1 class="reducedaltnotalic">The Works</h1>
				<p class="noindent">VSE does not require Script Extender. However, if you have SE installed and happen to want to reanimate every skeleton from this mod's parent Skeleton Crew library all at once, you can open SE console, press enter, and type !vse_spawnall. There's a short delay between each skeleton to lighten the load on the game, so sit and wait until the console tells you it's done. Use the !vse_spawnall command at your own risk: might lock up or crash your game.</p>
