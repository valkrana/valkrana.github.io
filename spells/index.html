					<h1>Valkrana's Many-Tabbed Cookbook</h1><br>
					<p class="noindent" style="font-style:italic"><span>The spells below were recovered from the remains</span> of a waterlogged cookbook that once belonged to the awkward graftling necromancer, <a href="https://valkrana.github.io">Valkrana Vil Galath Faeri Miraquinal</a>.<br>
					<p><i>Some notes reveal her enthusiasm for skeletons—that a skeleton hurled by a negative energy geyser is simply immensely cute. The aftermath is only a useful side effect. Others reveal a keen interest in intel gathering—that information is the most valuable commodity. Others, a penchant for defense—more specifically, an obsession with the well-being of those dear to her. All lead to the pursuit of a better, more fine-tuned control over both necromancy and the skeletons over which her necromancy grants dominion.</i>

					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
					<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a cookie charm, bone meal)<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>

					Choose a type of cookie that you have eaten in the past. You channel the spirit of the departed cookie to create in your palm a necromantic facsimile of a cookie of its type. The cookie, which exudes a deep dark aura, has no nutritional value. However, it is edible, and tastes like the cookie chosen at the time of casting.<br><br>

					<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pock-marked hyoid bone)<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>

					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see would provoke an Attack of Opportunity by you or an undead creature you control<br>
					<b>Range:</b> 120 feet<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a chevron bone)<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>

					You may instead have any undead creature over which a class feature or necromancy spell has given you control, either directly or indirectly, make an attack on either the provoking creature or another target. This doesn’t use the creature’s reaction.<br><br>

					<p class="noindent"><i>3rd-level necromancy</i><br>
					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
					<b>Range:</b> 60 feet<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M (an undead creature under your control, which the spell destroys)<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><br>

					Choose one undead creature within range over which a class feature or necromancy spell has given you control, either directly or indirectly, and a target square within 120 feet. A geyser of negative energy erupts beneath the creature, causing it to careen into the target square and explode in a 15-foot-radius sphere of negative energy and bones. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw, or take 3d12 necrotic damage and 2d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>

					<p class="noindent"><i>3rd-level necromancy</i><br>
					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
					<b>Range:</b> Touch<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pouch of multifarious bones)<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> 8 hours<br><br>

					A disc of bones converges to float around the target, trailing wisps of negative energy. The bones are calm unless provoked by an incoming attack, at which point they form into a defense.<br><br>

					Whenever the target is attacked, roll a d4 and add the result to the target’s AC for the attack.<br><br>

					This spell ends once it has affected a number of attacks equal to 2 + your spellcasting modifier, minimum 2. The target can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.<br><br>

					<p class="noindent"><i>4th-level necromancy</i><br>
					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
					<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br><br>

					You swap skeletons; then, a second later, the rest. When you cast this spell, and at the end of each of your turns before the spell ends, you can choose to trade places with one undead creature over which a class feature or necromancy spell has given you control, either directly or indirectly, and which is within 120 feet. Until the end of your next turn, the undead creature with which you have traded places gains temporary hit points equal to your character level.<br><br>

					<p class="noindent"><i>5th-level necromancy</i><br>
					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br>
					<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a charred scapula incised with eyes)<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>

					Your necromancy leaves a lasting impression. Choose one undead creature over which a class feature or necromancy spell has ever given you control, either directly or indirectly, which has an Intelligence of 11 or lower. If you no longer control the creature, it must fail on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC in order for this spell to succeed on that creature. If the target creature is on a different plane than you, there is a 5% chance the spell fails.<br><br>

					For the duration of the spell, you both control the creature (issuing mental commands with no action required by you) and share its senses, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has when perceiving through its senses.<br><br>

					<p class="noindent"><i>8th-level necromancy</i><br>
					<b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br>
					<b>Range:</b> Self<br>
					<b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br>
					<b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br><br>

					You swap skeletons; then, a second later, the rest. When you cast this spell, and at the end of each of your turns before the spell ends, you can choose to trade places with one undead creature over which a class feature or necromancy spell has ever given you control, either directly or indirectly, and which has an Intelligence of 11 or lower. If the target creature is on a different plane than you, there is a 5% chance the swap fails, but this does not cause the spell to end prematurely.<br><br>

					When swapping in this manner, you can choose to bring with you a number of willing target creatures up to your spellcasting modifier, and can change these targets with each subsequent swap.<br><br>
