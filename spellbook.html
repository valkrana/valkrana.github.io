				<div><p class="noindent">These choice examples are but a few of Valkrana's signature spells that have been transcribed from her personal grimoire into Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition format and mechanics.

					<!--<div class="item-spells">
						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Shadowfell Salvo</h1><hr class="boyhowdy">
						<p class="noindentitalic">1st-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: 60 feet<br>
						Components: V, S<br>
						Duration: Instantaneous<br>
						<p class="noindent">Description: Launch two projectiles straight from the Shadowfell at one or more targets within range. Each deals 1d10 Necrotic damage. Advantage against targets that are heavily obscured or in a Negative Energy Field.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional projectile for each slot level above 1st.
					</div>-->
					<div class="item-spells">
						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Lesser Skeleport</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">3rd-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Bonus Action<br>
						Range: 100 feet<br>
						Components: V<br>
						Duration: 1 minute<br>
						<p class="noindent">Description: Swap skeletons with target corpse or friendly undead within range. Then, a second later, swap the rest. If you can't see your target, you must be able to visualize its location. You may activate this effect again as a Bonus Action for the spell's duration.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is 8 hours.
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Negative Energy Field</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">4th-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: Self (30-foot radius)<br>
						Components: V, S<br>
						Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
						<p class="noindent">Description: Channel a field thick with necromancy that harms the living and empowers the undead. When you cast the spell, you can choose any number of creatures to be unaffected by it. When an undead enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it heals 1d12, has Turn Immunity, adds 1d12 Necrotic damage to its total damage dealt, and has its base movement speed increased by 10 feet. Living creatures instead suffer 1d12 Necrotic damage. Most reanimation spells don't require a corpse due to the abundance of negative energy in its area.<br><br>
						Casting this spell using on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, all die values increase by 1d12 and the duration is 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 9th level, the duration is 8 hours.
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1 class="reducedalt">Valkrana's Arc Vivisector</h1>
						<p class="noindentitalic">6th-level necromancy<br>
						Casting Time: Action<br>
						Range: Self (150-foot line)<br>
						Components: V, S, M (a coil of wire)<br>
						Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes<br>
						<p class="noindent">Description: Discharge a galvanized blast of necrotic energy that arcs from your palm in a line 100 feet long and 15 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 3d12 necrotic damage and 3d12 lightning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Creatures wearing armor made of metal have disadvantage on the saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw then dies to this spell, its charred meat sloughs cleanly from its skeleton.<br><br>
						<b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot above 6th.
