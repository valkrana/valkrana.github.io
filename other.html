						Valkrana fumbles multiple greetings, and your board. All that effort keeping it dry; now it's damp and dirty. She doesn't seem to care, just focuses on the lines to your sides. Whispers erupt around you. You can't help but shiverâ€”yours might just be the first shikishi with a personal touch! You place it before her. She regards your soiled board with contempt only as long as it takes to place her autograph. You shiver at that, too. Then her attention flicks to the boards at her other two hands as she slides yours forward without another word. You snatch it up and hurry off, too overcome with glee to notice all the envious stares trained your way. What a rush! What a wonder! She didn't even care! This was worth your life savings!</i></div>
